                    <span>
                        &emsp; I love you every single second of the day. I am always lost in your thoughts. There isn't a single moment you are not present in my mind. It's like you are a part of me. I watch your pictures for like more than 1000 times a day and I am amazed every single glance I look at it. You are a dream come true.
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  So, I would like to tell you once again that I love you very very very much, even more than any word in any language can explain. You know that I am not very good at expressing my feelings but still I want you to know that you are really very precious to me. Your are a blessing to me from God himself. I am very grateful to have you in my life and I am thankful and very lucky to be calling you mine. Every moment I look forward to talk to you, see you, feel you and be with you. म माया तिमीलाई धेरै माया गर्छु भूमिका <3
